## Introduction
This terminal based application is designed to help users manage their financial goals effectively. Whether they are saving for a holiday, car, house, or any other personal goals, this application will provide a structured way to track their progress, make contributions and stay informed about their milestones and dealines.

## Overview of Features
* <b>Goal Management:</b> Users will be able to easily add, edit, and delete their financial goals. Each goal includes name, target amount, and deadline.

* <b>Contributions:</b> Users will be able to make contributions towards their goals an dtrack how much they have saved over time.
* <b>Progress Tracking:</b> Users can view their progress of each goal and their overall savings at a glance.
* <b>History of Contributions:</b> Users can view a detailed history of their contributions made, allowing them to see how much they've contributed to each goal.
* <b>Monthly Reports:</b> Users can get generated monthly reports to review their savings and contributions for any given month.

## Implementation Plan
1. <b> Identify and understand the requirements:</b>

    The application needs to:
    - Help users manage their saving goals.
    - Allow users to add, edit, and delete saving goals.
    - Enable users to contribute to their saving goals.
    - Track their progress of each goal.
    - Provide a history of contributions.
    - Generate monthly reports of contributions.

2. <b>Designing the Application Structure:</b>

    The application is divided into several modules to seperate concerns and improve maintainability:
    - <b>```data_manager.py```:</b>
        - Purpose: to manage data storage and retrieval. 
        - ```load_data(data)``` function: ensures that existing data is loaded, and if there is no existing data, a new JSON file is created.
        - ```save_data(data)```:  Save user input data to JSON file.

        - <u>Checklist:</u>
            - [x] Imports necessary modules(json and os)
            - [x] File path configuration: Defines a file path where data will be stored ```user_data.json```
            - [x] Loading data: checks if data file ```user_data.json``` already exists using ```os.path.exists(FILE_PATH)```
            - [x] Create new JSON file if none exists.
            - [x] DRY Coding: Functions are short, reuseable and easy to maintain.
            - [x] Default data structure for goals and contributions are stated.
            - [x] Comments are provided extensively.

    - <b> ```goal_manager.py``` function:</b>

            - [x] Error handling: Customer input index is validated each time. Error messsage is displayed when necessary.
            - [x] DRY code: Functions are focused on a single task. Functions are imported from data_manager to avoiding repeating.
            - [x] Comments are provided extensively.


    - <b>```contribution_manager.py```:</b> Manages contributions and viewing contribution history.
        - Purpose: Allows users to add contributions and view contribution history.

## Code Style Guide
This code follows the PEP 8 style guide. the official guide for Python code. PEP 8 provides readable and cosistent conventions for code. 
The following is a summary of PEP 8 Style guide:
* Indentation: Uses 4 spaces per indentation.
* Blank Lines: Surround top-level function and class definitions with two lines. Method definitions are surrounded by a single blanke line.
* Imports: Imports are placed together at the top of the the file.
* Whitespace: Use of whitespace to seperate elements in code, such as operators, commas and semicolons.
* Comments: Inline comments used with space after the ```#``` symbol.
* Naming Conventions: Use descriptive names for variables, functions and classes. functions and variables should be lowercase, with words seperated by underscores ```(snake_case)```
