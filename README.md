## Implementation Plan
1. <b> Identify and understand the requirements:</b>

    The application needs to:
    - Help users manage their saving goals.
    - Allow users to add, edit, and delete saving goals.
    - Enable users to contribute to their saving goals.
    - Track their progress of each goal.
    - Provide a history of contributions.
    - Generate monthly reports of contributions.

2. <b>Designing the Application Structure:</b>

    The application is divided into several modules to seperate concerns and improve maintainability:
    - <b>```data_manager.py```:</b>
        - Purpose: to manage data storage and retrieval. 
        - ```load_data(data)``` function: ensures that existing data is loaded, and if there is no existing data, a new JSON file is created.
        - ```save_data(data)```:  Save user input data to JSON file.

        - <u>Checklist:</u>
            - [x] Imports necessary modules(json and os)
            - [x] File path configuration: Defines a file path where data will be stored ```user_data.json```
            - [x] Loading data: checks if data file ```user_data.json``` already exists using ```os.path.exists(FILE_PATH)```
            - [x] Create new JSON file if none exists.
            - [x] DRY Coding: Functions are short, reuseable and easy to maintain.
